A vehicle tracking device can work by two types of technology:

The tracker installed in the car issues a signal indicating the vehicle coordinates. These coordinates are displayed on a map, which can be accessed via the website or application by the driver, who can see the exact location of the vehicle. The tracker can work through two types of technology:

Radiofrequency: This is the most advanced type of tracking, achieving vehicle location even indoors or indoors. It is suitable for those who live in large cities that have more interference and signal interruption, such as tunnels and buildings.

GPS: This is the most commonly used form of vehicle tracking. It has wide coverage, working anywhere in the world. Its main disadvantage is that it suffers interference from physical barriers, that is, it does not usually work indoors.

Car trackers are very useful, as well as giving you the security of always knowing where your vehicle is (you'll never lose your car in the parking lot), you can control the mileage traveled, and some models even have lockers or buttons. panic attacks that can be triggered in emergencies.
